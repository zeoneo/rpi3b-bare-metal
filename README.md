# rpi3b-bare-metal   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zeoneo/rpi3b-bare-metal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zeoneo/rpi3b-bare-metal)



This tutorial supports only Raspberry Pi 3 B model and tutorial is target at 32 bits.

I am going to attempt bare metal programming on Raspberry Pi 3 B.

1. Get UART0 working.
2. Get ARM Timer working.
3. Get Interrupt working.
4.

How to run code.

change working directory to /src/lesson-name
`make` It will build kernel8-32.img file.
copy this file to sd card.

It's important to check files in Disk Image folder. Disk Image is ideal setup for lessons to work.

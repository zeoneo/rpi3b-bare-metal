# RPI 3B (32 BIT) OS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zeoneo/rpi3b-bare-metal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zeoneo/rpi3b-bare-metal)

Initial setup taken from osdev meaty-skeleton

I am trying to come up with RPI os. individual tutorials are in src folder.

I am using src/00-bootloader to test my kernel. it is based on raspbootin. please search github raspbootin for more info.


As of today (May 19, 2019) this repo only contains device drivers which are essential for any operating system.

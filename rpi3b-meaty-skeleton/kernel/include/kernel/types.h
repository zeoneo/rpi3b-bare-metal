	\brief Result of a method call.

	Negative results are errors.
	OK is for a general success.
	ErrorGeneral is an undisclosed failure.
	ErrorArgument is a bad input.
	ErrorRetry is a temporary issue that may disappear, the method should be rerun
		without modification (the caller is expected to limit number of retries as
		required).
	ErrorDevice is a more permenant hardware error (a reset procedure should be
		enacted before retrying).
	ErrorIncompatible is a device driver that will not support the detected
		device.
	ErrorCompiler is a problem with the configuration of the compiler generating
		unusable code.
	ErrorMemory is used when the memory is exhausted.
	ErrorTimeout is used when a maximum delay is reached when waiting and an 
		operation is unfinished. This does not necessarily mean the operationg 
		will not finish, just that it is unreasonably slow.
	ErrorDisconnected is used when a device is disconnected in transfer.
